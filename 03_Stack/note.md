# Stack

## 1. Definition
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO principle
(Last In, First Out).

## 2. Basic Operations
- Push: insert an element
- Pop: remove the top element
- Peek/Top: view the top element

## 3. Implementation
This stack is implemented using an array.

## 4. Time Complexity
- Push: O(1)
- Pop: O(1)
- Peek: O(1)

## 5. Applications
- Function calls (call stack)
- Expression evaluation
- Undo/Redo operations

## 6. Reflection
Stack is simple but very powerful for managing order of execution.
