# Queue

## 1. Definition
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle
(First In, First Out).

## 2. Basic Operations
- Enqueue: insert an element at the rear
- Dequeue: remove an element from the front
- Front/Peek: view the first element

## 3. Implementation
This queue is implemented using an array (circular queue).

## 4. Time Complexity
- Enqueue: O(1)
- Dequeue: O(1)
- Peek: O(1)

## 5. Applications
- Print queue
- Task scheduling
- BFS traversal

## 6. Reflection
Queue is essential for managing order and processing tasks fairly.
