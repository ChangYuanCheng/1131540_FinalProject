# Tree

## 1. Definition
A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes,
with a single root and zero or more child nodes.

## 2. Binary Search Tree (BST)
- A BST is a binary tree where for each node:
  - Left subtree contains values < node
  - Right subtree contains values > node
- No duplicate values (optional)

## 3. Basic Operations
- Insert
- Search
- Traversals: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder

## 4. Time Complexity
- Search: O(h) on average, O(n) worst-case
- Insert: O(h)
- Delete: O(h)
where h = height of the tree

## 5. Applications
- Searching and sorting
- Expression trees
- Priority queues (with heap)

## 6. Reflection
BST provides efficient search and insertion if balanced.
