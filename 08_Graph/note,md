# Graph

## 1. Definition
A graph G = (V, E) is a collection of vertices (V) and edges (E).

## 2. Types
- Directed / Undirected
- Weighted / Unweighted

## 3. Representation
- Adjacency List
- Adjacency Matrix

## 4. Traversals
- BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- DFS (Depth-First Search)

## 5. Applications
- Network routing
- Social networks
- Topological sorting
- Shortest path algorithms

## 6. Reflection
Graph is versatile for modeling connections and relationships.
