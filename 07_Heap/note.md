# Heap

## 1. Definition
A heap is a complete binary tree which satisfies the heap property:
- **Min Heap**: parent ≤ children
- **Max Heap**: parent ≥ children

## 2. Operations
- Insert
- Delete (usually root)
- Peek (root element)

## 3. Time Complexity
- Insert: O(log n)
- Delete: O(log n)
- Peek: O(1)

## 4. Applications
- Priority Queue
- Heap Sort
- Scheduling algorithms

## 5. Reflection
Heap is efficient for maintaining dynamic sets with fast access to min/max.
